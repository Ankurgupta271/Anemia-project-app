## 🧬 Introduction

Anemia is a condition characterized by a deficiency in red blood cells or hemoglobin, reducing the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. Our project proposes a **computer-aided diagnostic system** that is:

- Cost-effective  
- Time-efficient  
- Accurate and scalable

> 🚀 **Goal**: Early and precise anemia diagnosis using a CNN-based model integrated into a mobile app.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Manual diagnosis of anemia is time-consuming and subjective. There's a lack of practical applications using deep learning and explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

✅ We aim to build a **reliable, fast, and interpretable** anemia detection system using state-of-the-art ML tools.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Collect and preprocess medical datasets  
- Train and fine-tune a **CNN** model for anemia classification  
- Integrate **Explainable AI (XAI)** for better result interpretation  
- Deploy the model in a **real-time mobile application**

---

## 🔬 Types of Anemia Covered

- **Sickle Cell Anemia**  
- **Aplastic Anemia**
